Gull 2.9 alpha @ 26.01.2014
	This version is a base for Gull 3 development. It has no multi-cpu support, since I haven't yet decided 
	whether to implement SMP via processes or threads. 
	Maximum hash table size is 1Gb.
	Should be slightly stronger than 2.8 beta at ultra short time controls due to minor differences in move generation algorithm.
	At blitz and long time controls the ELO difference is likely to be well within error margins of most rating lists.
